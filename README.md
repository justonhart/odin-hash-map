# Odin Hash Map

This project is part of the Odin Project, a self-driven web development training program. Learn more at [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/).

## Project summary

The assignment for this project was to implement HashMap using JavaScript. I prefer TypeScript so I used that instead. I used Jest to test my implementation, and everything seems to work as specified. There was a test script defined in the project prompt, so I did my best to include that in my test suite as well. I modified the code from my LinkedList implementation to fit the specification for this project, and wrote tests for that code as well.
